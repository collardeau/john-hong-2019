  <p>
    My work is like a song. You can feel what it says before you know what it
    means. I am influenced by Korean temple painting and the Japanese Rinpa
    school. The use of handmade paper in much of my work helps to build a bridge
    between drawing and painting. Some of my inspirations are improvisational
    music, mythology and dance.
